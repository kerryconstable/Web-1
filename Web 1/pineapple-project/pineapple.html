        <p>Few culinary crimes have sparked as much controversy as the act of placing pineapple on pizza. For Italians, this isn’t just a questionable topping choice—it’s a full-blown cultural assault. Pizza Is a Sacred Art, Not a Fruit Bowl.                   								In Italy, pizza-making is a craft, almost spiritual in its significance. Chefs train for years to achieve the perfect balance of dough, sauce, and toppings. Then pineapple comes along, turning this sacred art into a tropical smoothie experiment. 
Sacrilege!
Italian cuisine thrives on simplicity and harmony. Think Margherita pizza: just tomato, mozzarella, and basil—a masterpiece. Pineapple, with its sticky sweetness, disrupts the balance. It’s culinary chaos, the kind that keeps Italians awake at night muttering
Not to mention the  "Hawaiian" Label Adds Insult to Injury					Hawaiian pizza is often blamed for this travesty, but let’s be clear: no Hawaiian actually invented it (a Canadian did). Italians feel doubly insulted because not only is this topping an affront to pizza, but it’s also geographically incorrect. Why drag Hawaii into this mess?
In Italy, tourists often gleefully order pineapple pizza, thinking it’s universally beloved. Watching this unfold is like witnessing someone dunk a biscotti into red wine. Locals will shake their heads in silent despair, wondering if there’s any hope for humanity.

The Trauma this has and is causing to not just those with Italian heritage but to all those who have a true love of good food everywhere has reached it’s limit.
Truly, when will enough be enough!
