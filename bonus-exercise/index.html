    <h2>My Special Interest in Sketching</h2>
    <p>I have always had a love for drawing and Art. In particular, I have a passion for sketching people. Mostly I grab an photography portrait I am attracted to and see if I can capture it. </p>
   <p><br>I don't know why, but I have always been attracted to faces that show emotion coming from within. The feeling's that arn't obvious. Like Sadness, and Longing. Or the quiet signs of a hard life lived.
       Ironically I am none of those things. <em>Below is a a classic example of that kind of sketch.</em> </p>
